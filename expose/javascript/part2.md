1. It will print 3 because the value of i, the counter that goes up to the size of the array, is 3 at the end of the for loop.
2. It will print 150 because the during the last iteration of the foor loop, the variable discountedPrice got assigned 300*(1-0.5), which evaluates to 150.
3. It will print 150, because in the last iteration of the for loop, the value that finalPrice gets assigned is 150.
4. It will return discounted, which is an array holding all the discounted prices, because during the for loop, for each element in the prices array, we calculated the discounted price and pushed it onto the discounted array. So, by the time the for loop is done, it contains all the discounted prices. 
5. error, because due to being declared using let, i's scope is only in the for loop , so it cannot be printed outside of that scope. 
6. error, because discountedPrice's scope is only in the for loop, so it cannot be printed outside of that scope 
7. It will print 150 because finalPrice was declared in the same scope, so it is accessible. The final value of final price is 150, so it will print 150.
8. It will return discounted, which is an array holding all the discounted prices, because it was declared in the same scope and so is accessible. During the for loop, for each element in the prices array, we calculated the discounted price and pushed it onto the discounted array. So, by the time the for loop is done, it contains all the discounted prices. 
9. error, because due to being declared using let, i's scope is only in the for loop, so it cannot be printed outside of that scope. 
10. It will print 3,
11. It will return discounted, which is an array holding all the discounted prices, because it was declared in the same scope and so is accessible. During the for loop, for each element in the prices array, we calculated the discounted price and pushed it onto the discounted array. So, by the time the for loop is done, it contains all the discounted prices.
